```cmd
lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
```
The command lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN is used to list all the network sockets that are currently in a listening state. Here's what each part of the command does:

lsof: This is the command that lists open files and network sockets.

-i: This option tells lsof to only show network sockets.

-P: This option tells lsof to use port numbers instead of service names.

-n: This option tells lsof not to resolve hostnames or port names.

|: This is a pipe symbol that connects the output of the lsof command to the grep command.

grep LISTEN: This command searches for the word "LISTEN" in the output of the lsof command. 

The word "LISTEN" indicates that the network socket is in a listening state, which means 
that it is waiting for incoming connections.

By running this command, you can see all the network sockets that are currently listening for incoming connections on your system. In the case of the example output you provided earlier, the command shows that the system is listening on port 22 for incoming SSH connections, and that the PostgreSQL server is listening on ports 5432 for incoming database connections.
